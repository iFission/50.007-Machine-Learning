```

pick RBF kernel, best accuracy

### linear kernel

```bash
./svm-train -t 0 training.txt
....*....*
optimization finished, #iter = 1300
nu = 0.383536
obj = -45.603329, rho = 2.741710
nSV = 78, nBSV = 39
Total nSV = 78
```

```bash
./svm-predict test.txt training.txt.model output.txt
Accuracy = 74.6032% (47/63) (classification)
```

### polynomial kernel

```bash
./svm-train -t 1 training.txt
*
optimization finished, #iter = 75
nu = 0.937931
obj = -125.139653, rho = 0.936664
nSV = 138, nBSV = 135
Total nSV = 138
```

```bash
./svm-predict test.txt training.txt.model output.txt
Accuracy = 53.9683% (34/63) (classification)
```

### radial basis function kernel

```bash
./svm-train -t 2 training.txt

- optimization finished, #iter = 84
  nu = 0.786384
  obj = -92.436556, rho = 0.322969
  nSV = 119, nBSV = 108
  Total nSV = 119
```

```bash
./svm-predict test.txt training.txt.model output.txt
Accuracy = 84.127% (53/63) (classification)
```

### sigmoid kernel

```bash
./svm-train -t 3 training.txt

- optimization finished, #iter = 73
  nu = 0.845815
  obj = -106.031541, rho = 1.311923
  nSV = 124, nBSV = 121
  Total nSV = 124
```

```bash
./svm-predict test.txt training.txt.model output.txt
Accuracy = 79.3651% (50/63) (classification)
